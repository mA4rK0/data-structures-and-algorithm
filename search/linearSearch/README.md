# Linear Search

Linear Search is used when the items in a list or array are in random order. Linear search can iterate through a collection one element at a time. search for data in a list is to begin at the first element and move to each element in the list until you either find the data you are looking for or you reach the end of the list. It uses time complexity of Linear Time (O(n)).
