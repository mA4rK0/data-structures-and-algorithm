# Sets

A set is a collection of unique elements. The elements of a set are called members. The two most important properties of sets are that the members of a set are unordered and that no member can occur in a set more than once. Sets play a very important role in computer science but are not considered a data type in many programming languages. Sets can be useful when you want to create a data structure that consists only of unique elements, such as a list of each unique word in a text. A set is an unordered collection of related members in which no member occurs more than once.

### Here are some definitions you need to know to work with sets:

1. A set containing no members is called the _empty set_. The _universe_ is the set of all possible members.
2. Two sets are considered equal if they contain exactly the same members.
3. A set is considered a _subset_ of another set if all the members of the first set are contained in the second set.

### The fundamental operations performed on sets are:

1. Union :
   A new set is obtained by combining the members of one set with the members of another set.
2. Intersection :
   A new set is obtained by adding all the members of one set that also exist in a second set.
3. Difference :
   A new set is obtained by adding all the members of one set except those that also exist in a second set.
