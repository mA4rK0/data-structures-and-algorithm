# Hash Table

Hash Table is a data structure that stores unique keys to values. Each key/value pair is known as an _Entry_. Hash Table are great for large data sets, fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval (Constant Time O(1)). But not good for searching, small data sets. collision can occurs in the Hash Table, there are two methods that can be used to preventing collision :

1. [Separate Chaining](https://github.com/mA4rK0/data-structures-and-algorithm/tree/main/hashTable/separateChaining) : use this method if the size of the array can be up to half the number of elements to be stored.
2. [Linear Probing]() : use this method if the size of the array can be twice the size of the number of elements to be stored.
