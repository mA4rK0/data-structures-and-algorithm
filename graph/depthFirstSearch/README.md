# Depth First Search

Depth First Search is a search algorithm for traversing a graph data structure. The algorithm for performing a depth-first search is relatively simple—visit a vertex that has not already been visited, mark it as having been visited, then recursively visit the other unvisited vertices that are in the original vertex’s adjacency list. Pick a route, keep going, if you reach a dead end or an already visited vertex, backtrack to a previous vertex with unvisited adjacent neighbors.
