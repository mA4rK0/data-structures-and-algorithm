# LIFO Stack (Last-in, First-out)
LIFO Stack is a data structure that stores objects like "vertical tower" Exm: books stack, CD's Stack. The data can be added or removed only from the top of a stack.
If you want to access the bottom object or the first object in the stack, you have to remove the last object first, to access the first object in the stack.
