# Shell Sort

This algorithm is based on the insertion sort but is a big improvement over that basic sorting algorithm. Shellsortâ€™s key concept is that it compares distant elements first, rather than adjacent elements, as is done in the insertion sort. Elements that are far out of place can be put into place more efficiently using this scheme than by simply comparing neighboring elements. As the algorithm loops through the data set, the distance between each element decreases until, when at the end of the data set, the algorithm is comparing elements that are adjacent. In this code, we will use shell sort algorithm with **Knuth Sequence**. Quasilinear Time (O(n log n)).
