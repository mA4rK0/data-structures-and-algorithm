# Linked Lists

A linked list is a collection of objects called nodes. Each node is linked to a successor node in the list using an object reference. Marking the beginning of a linked list can be a problem. Many linked-list implementations include a special node, called the head, to denote the beginning of a linked list. Linked list stores Nodes in 2 parts (data + address(next Node)), elements are linked using pointers. Linked list does not have indexes like array. Linked lists are good for inserting and deleting a data in the list (O(1) constant time). But not suitable for searching and looping a lot of data (Linear time O(n)).
